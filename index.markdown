## Work through Real-World Ethical Dilemmas

Pakistan is not an easy country to work in for journalists. The work is dangerous. People are corrupt. The rules are unclear.

There are no easy answers. What we offer is help in thinking about the ethical problems that journalists face every day.
		
## OK, but who are you?

We're [NearMedia](http://nearmediallc.com). We help journalists around the world improve their skills. Right now, we're working in Pakistan with a local nonprofit called [Media Foundation 360] (http://mediafoundation360.org) to form a national news cooperative called [News Lens Pakistan] (http://newslens.pk).
